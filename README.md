# SkypeTopologyTool
A Powershell script that takes a Skype/Lync Topology file and produces an Excel spreadsheet and Visio diagram to help visualize the data. 
Tested on small topology files with no errors however the Visio diagram for large topologies is not scaled correctly.

Requirements:
-Skype/Lync Topology file (.tbxml file extension)
-In order to build the Visio diagram you will need the Lync Stencil Pack, found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=20891. The file should go in your 'Documents\My shapes' folder. 

The Contoso.tbxml and output files are included as samples.
